  After a devastating breach exposed flaws in our legacy system, we overhauled security with two radical policies:
  1. Strict uniqueness: No duplicate usernames OR passwords allowed!
  2. Custom crypto: When bcrypt fell to attackers, we engineered our own secure hash algorithm (SHA? MD5? ...or something *entirely* new?).

  But whispers suggest remnants of old vulnerabilities linger... Can you shock the system back into chaos?
